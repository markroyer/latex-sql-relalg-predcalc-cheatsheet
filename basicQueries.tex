\subsubsection*{Other Notes:}

The keyword \texttt{DISTINCT} is required in the SQL queries for
projection, selection, and cross product in order to match the
first-order logic and relational algebra queries.  Without the
\texttt{DISTINCT} keyword in the \texttt{SELECT} clause, the SQL
results are multisets (bags).  The reason multisets are are used,
instead of sets by default, is to try to avoid any decrease in
performance due to duplicate removal.
